### **Step 2: Remove the Incorrectly Tracked Files from Git's Index**

This is the most critical step. You need to tell Git to stop tracking the files that should have been ignored. We will use the `git rm --cached` command, which removes the files from Git's tracking but **leaves them on your computer**.

**Action:** Open your terminal in the root of your `CareFlow-HMS` project and run these commands one by one:

1.  **Clear Git's cache completely (recommended for simplicity):**
    ```bash
    git rm -r --cached .
    ```
    * `rm` = remove
    * `-r` = recursive (to include everything in folders)
    * `--cached` = **IMPORTANT!** Only remove from Git's tracking index, not from your computer.

2.  **Re-add everything.** This time, Git will respect your `.gitignore` file and skip the ignored files:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

---

### **Step 3: Commit the Changes**

Now, commit this fix. This commit will record the removal of the unwanted files from tracking and any updates to your `.gitignore` file itself.

**Action:** Run the following commit command:

```bash
git commit -m "Fix: Clean up gitignore and untrack previously committed files"
```

---

### **Step 4: Verify and Push**

Before you push, you can run `git status` to see that `node_modules` and `.env` are no longer listed as modified files.

**Action:** Now, you can safely push your changes to GitHub.

```bash
git push origin main
